### 2. GitHub

#### 2.2 Pull requests

- you can pull from not only ~~other branches~~ but also from **~~forks other people made~~**
- After pull requests, you can **1)merge the pull requests to the repository if you are the owner of the repository** or **2)close the pull requests (to ignore the pull requests)**

#### 2.3 Origin and Upstream

- fork해서 작업 중일때, base repository가 업데이트 되었을 때의 대처방법
- **Upstream branch** : the branch which communicates with master branch in the base repository (Created when you **fork a repository**)
  → You can **fetch the changes on the base repository via upstream branch**
- 작업순서: base repository → upstream branch → current branch
  **1) fetch the changes from the origin** (base repository → upstream branch)  
  **2) merge the changes made on the origin to current branch** (upstream branch → current branch)

#### 2.4 Issues

- Creates issues, solve issues (pull requests), close issues
- Use in the companies for the project management

~~**fork&clone, pull, origin and upstream에 익숙해지자**~~
